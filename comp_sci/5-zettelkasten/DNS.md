### What is DNS?
- - -
- Domain Name System.
- A hierarchical and decentralized naming system for Internet connected resources.
- Maintains a list of domain names (website addresses) along with the resources, such as IP addresses, that are associated with them.
- Translates human-friendly domain names (e.g. mozilla.org) to a numeric [[IP Address]] (such as 192.0.2.172), also know as a ***DNS lookup***. 
- By contrast a ***reverse DNS lookup*** (rDNS) is used to determine the domain name associated with an IP address.
