In Morse code, every letter of the alphabet corresponds to a short series of dots and dashes.

|     |        |     |        |     |        |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------ | --- | ------ |
| A   | `._`   | J   | `.___` | S   | `...`  |
| B   | `_...` | K   | `_._`  | T   | `_`    |
| C   | `_._.` | L   | `._..` | U   | `.._`  |
| D   | `_..`  | M   | `__`   | V   | `..._` |
| E   | `.`    | N   | `_.`   | W   | `.__`  |
| F   | `.._.` | O   | `___`  | X   | `_.._` |
| G   | `__.`  | P   | `.__.` | Y   | `_.__` |
| H   | `....` | Q   | `__._` | Z   | `__..` |
| I   | `..`   | R   | `._.   |     |        |

*Code* usually means a system for transferring information among people and machines.

Various types of codes are also used in computers to store and communicate numbers, sounds, music, pictures, and movies.

By convention, in Morse code, the length of a dash should be about thrice that of a dot.

Pauses are crucial. Letters in the same word are separated by longer pauses equal to about the length of one dash. Words are separated by an off period of about two dashes.

`...___...` stands for SOS.

One drawback of Morse code is that it makes no differentiation between uppercase and lowercase letters.

In addition to representing letters, Morse also includes codes for numbers by using a series of five dots and dashes:

|     |         |     |         |
| --- | ------- | --- | ------- |
| 1   | `.____` | 6   | `_....` |
| 2   | `..___` | 7   | `__...` |
| 3   | `...__` | 8   | `___..` |
| 4   | `...._` | 9   | `____.` |
| 5   | `.....` | 0   | `_____` |

Most punctuation marks use five, six, or seven dots and dashes:

|     |          |     |           |
| --- | -------- | --- | --------- |
| .   | `._._._` | ‘   | `.____.`  |
| ,   | `__..__` | (   | `_.__.`   |
| ?   | `..__..` | )   | `_.__._`  |
| :   | `___...` | =   | `_..._`   |
| ;   | `_._._.` | +   | `._._.`   |
| -   | `_...._` | $   | `..._.._` |
| /   | `_.._.`  | ¶   | `._._..`  |
| “   | `._.._.` | _   | `..__._`  |

Additional codes are defined for accented letters of some European languages and as shorthand sequences for special purposes.

Morse code can be used vocally to substitute for normal speech. For maximum speed, you pronounce dot as *dih* (or *dit* for the last dot of a letter) and a dash as *dah*.

In the same way that Morse code reduces written language to dots and dashes, the spoken version of the code reduces speech to just two vowel sounds.

The keyword here is *two*. Two types of blinks, two vowel sounds, two different anything, really, can with suitable combinations convey all types of information.
