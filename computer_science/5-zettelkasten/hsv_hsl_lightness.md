### Defining Lightness
- **Lightness** indicates the level of illumination in the HSL color space.
- It ranges from `0%` for Black (no light) to `100%` for full illumination that washes the hue so it appears as White.
- Hues at percentages less than `50%` appear darker while hues at greater than `50%` appear lighter.
