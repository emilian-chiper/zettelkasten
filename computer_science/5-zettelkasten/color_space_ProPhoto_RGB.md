### ProPhoto RGB
- Developed by Kodak in the late ‘90’s, available in early 2000.
- Offers a very large gamut, beyond sRGB, designed for use with photographic output.
- Encompasses about **79%** of the colors specified in the 1931 CIE chromaticity diagram.
- Approximately **13%** of the colors in ProPhoto RGB do not exist and are *imaginary* colors.
- Converting a ProPhoto RGB image to sRGB, Adobe RGB, or CMYK formats can result in unexpected and undesired colors.
