### Value
- The **value** of a color refers to how light or dark a given hue is.
- The scale of value ranges from `0` for pure Black `#000` to `10` for pure white `#fff` along a vertical axis.
- Each step is divided into decimal increments and results in a 100 step lightness scale.
- Black, White, and the Grays between them are  defined as having no hue and are called *neutral colors*.
- The notation **N** is used to indicate the Gray value at any point of the vertical axis.
- Colors that have a hew are called *chromatic colors*.
- The value scale is applied to chromatic and neutral colors.
- The value attribute of the Munsell color order system is considered the backbone or *trunk* of the color tree.
- The hue circle or color wheel resides at `5N` in the middle level of the value attribute.
- The value of a specific hew is noted with the value at the end of the hue designation, e.g. `5Y 4/` indicates a middle Yellow at the value level of 4.
- The value scale is defined as perceptual or visual.
- It is based on how humans see differences in relative light and is not based on a set of mathematical values from a light source.
