### Geometry of the Munsell Color Order System
- Munsell developed his system as an orb.
- Around the  equator runs a band of colors that defines the *hue* attribute.
- The axis of the orb encompasses a scale of neutral Gray values with White at the top of the pole and Black at the bottom.
- This axis defines the *value* attribute.
- Extending horizontally from the axis at each Gray value is a gradation of color moving from neutral Gray at the center of the orb to full saturation at the outer ring, this progression defining *chroma*.
