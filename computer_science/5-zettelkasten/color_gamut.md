### Color Gamut
- **Color gamut** = the range of colors a device can reproduce.

#### Variations in range
- Compared to the human eye-brain visual system, color imaging devices such as digital cameras, mobile phone, scanners, monitors, and printers have a smaller and narrow range of colors.
- The range of colors displayed on an RGB display device or is usually greater than the range of colors that can be produced by a CMYK printer.
- Converting digital media between devices alters the color gamut of the original source image, with some colors being lost in the process.

#### Variations in luminosity
- Typically, Reds, Greens and Blues with high luminosity on an RGB display device are not easily reproduced using only CMYK ink or toner.
- Presently, there are no devices that can reproduce the entire visible spectrum of human color vision.

#### Color gamut diagram
- A common method used to draw or diagram the color gamut of a device is to work with the *x-y chromaticity diagram of the XYZ color space* established in 1931 by the CIE.

- The color gamut of a typical computer monitor.
- The Gray upside-down-U or horseshoe shape represents the entire range of colors in the visible spectrum of cromaticity values based on the CIE 1931 XYZ color space.
- The color triangle inside the horseshoe represents the color gamut available to some particular device.
- The corners of the triangle show the primary colors of this gamut, with Red being the right point of the triangle, Green being the top point, and Blue being the left point of the triangle.
