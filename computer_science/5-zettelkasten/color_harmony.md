### Color Harmony
- **Color harmony** is the process of choosing colors that work well together in the composition of an image.
- Similar to concepts in music, there are *color cords* on the color wheel that help to provide common guidelines for how hues will work together.
- These colors cords are generalized recommendations with the final color selection dependent on specific parameters associated with the design project.
- An important aspect in working with color harmony is determining a key color to build the harmonies around.
