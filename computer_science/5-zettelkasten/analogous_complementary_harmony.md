### Analogous Complementary Harmony
- The **analogous complementary** harmony represents a key color combined wit hits direct complement and the two colors on either side of the complement.
- In RGB/CMYK, the analogous complementary harmony in the key of Yellow combines Yellow with Cyan Blue, Blue, and Blue Magenta.
- In the RYB color space, the analogous complementary harmony in the key of Yellow combines Yellow and the three Purples that encompass Blue Purple, Purple, and Purple Red.

#### Formula
- An analogous complementary color scheme is a four-color combination consisting of a base color (`H0`) and another color (`H1`) that is `180°` apart from `H0` on the color wheel, as well as its analogues, `30°`  apart.
	- `H1 = |(H0 + 180°) - 360°|`
	- `H2 = |(H0 + 150°) - 360°|`
	- `H3 = |(H0 + 210°) - 360°|`
