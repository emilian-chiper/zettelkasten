### Opponent Processing Color Theory
- 1878 – *Ewald Hering* challenges the theory of trichromatic color vision.
- Vision occurs in three channels where the opposite colors are in competition:
	- a Red Green channel,
	- a Yellow Blue channel,
	- a Black White channel.
- The Black White channel, or *achromatic system* addresses *brightness contrast*.
- Together, the Red Green channel and Yellow Blue channel create a *chromatic system* for *color contrast*.
- Hering said that there were four primary colors with Red and Green opposing each other, and Yellow and Blue opposing each other.
- We do not see Reddish Green combinations of color.
- The same issue is true for Yellowish Blue combinations.
- At the core of this system lies Hering’s experimentation with *afterimages*.
- For example:
	- Red and Green are opposite colors.
	- If we focus our vision on a Red dot and then gaze at a White wall, we will see a Green dot as an afterimage.
	- The reverse is also true.
	- The same applies to Blue and Yellow.

### Modern Findings
- 1957 - *Leo Hurvich* and *Dorothea Jameson* provided quantitative data to support Hering’s opponent processing color theory.
- They defined the concept of *hue cancellation methods*.
- Conclusions:
	(1) Red and Green lights mixed together to produce Yellow light, not Reddish Green.
	(2) Blue and Yellow lights mixed together to produce White light, not Yellowish Blue.
	(3) Red and Green cancel each other, as do Yellow and Blue.
- Starting with Blueish Green, it is possible to mix Yellow light with Blueish Green light to cancel out blue, resulting in the production of Green light.
- Trichromatic color vision coexists with the opponent processing color theory:
	- Helmholtz’s theory of trichromatic color vision explains what happens with our eyes at the photoreceptor level.
	- Hering’s opponent processing color theory explains aspects of color vision processing at the neural level when images are transferred from the eye to the brain via the optic nerve.
