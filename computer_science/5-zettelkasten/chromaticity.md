### Chromaticity
- **Chromaticity** is defined as an objective specification of the quality of a given color irrespective of the given colorâ€™s luminance.
- It is specified by two independent parameters frequently noted as *hue* and *colorfulness*, where the latter is also defined as *saturation*, *chroma*, *intensity*, or *purity* depending on the color space such as [Hue Saturation and Value (HSV)]([[hsv_color_space]]), [Hue Saturation and Brightness (HSB)]([[hsb_color_space]]), the [Munsell Color System]([[munsell_color_system]]), the [Internassional Commision on Illumination (CIE) 1931 XYZ color space]([[cie_1931_xyz_color_space]]), the [CIE LUV]([[cie_luv_color_space]]), and the [CIE LAB]([[cie_lab_color_space]]) color spaces.
