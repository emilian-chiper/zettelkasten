### Trichromacy
- Each of the retina’s three types of cone cells contains a different kind of *photosensitive pigment*.
- The pigments are composed of a transmembrane protein called *opsin* and a light-sensitive molecule called *11-cis retinal*.
- The *Red* cones:
	- Are sensitive to a range of *long wavelengths*, meaning they aren’t only activated by wavelengths of Red light, but also Orange, Yellow, and even Green.
	- Peak sensitivity in the *Green to Yellow* range of the visible spectrum.
- The *Green* cones:
	- Most sensitive to *medium wavelengths* of Green light, can also be activated by Yello and Blue lights.
	- Peak sensitivity in the *Green* range of the visible spectrum.
- The *Blue* cones:
	- Sensitive to *short wavelengths* of Violet and Blue lights.
	- Peak sensitivity in *Violet to Blue* range of the visible spectrum.
- **Trichromacy** is the condition of having three independent channels for conveying color information to our brain.
- The brain can’t discriminate different colors with input from only one type of cone.
- The brain’s processing of the electrical messages sent by all three types of cones is called *psychological response to light*.
- The sensitivity of our cones to long, medium, and short wavelengths is used to define the concept of *long, medium, and short colors space* (**LMScs**).
- LMScs is useful in the study of color deficiencies where one or more cone types are defective.
