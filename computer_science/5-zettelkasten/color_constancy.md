### Color Constancy
- Yellow ðŸŸ¡ is defined in RGB values as (255, 255, 0).
- The use of the range 0-255 to define digital (RGB) color is based on *computer memory*.
- Color for a given object is stored in memory in *binary* form.
- Each binary switch (0 or 1) is called a *bit* and 8 bits form a *byte*.
- If there are 8 bits in a sequence, there are *256* possibilities to configure these switches, yielding a range of numbers between *0* and *255*.
- Our human color perception system provides the ability to comprehend the color of objects irrespective of the light source used to illuminate them.
- For example, we identify the same Yellow color of a banana under bright sunlight, under fluorescent light, or candlelight.
- Even though the surrounding light source might cause more Orange hues or even Green hues to actually reach our eyes, our brain corrects this to keep the Yellow color of the banana constant.
- This phenomenon is called **color constancy**.
- Our brain disregards the continual changes in the wavelengths of light reflected from a surface.
- This stability allows us to categorize color-related properties of objects consistently as we transition through our daily processes of living.
- Light itself has no color.
- Light is a wave with either a specific wavelength or a minx thereof.
- An object that emits or reflects light appears to have color to our eyes.
- This is due to both physiological and psychological responses to the wavelength.
