### CIE LUV
- Is a transformation of the CIE XYZ color that represents an attempt to achieve a greater correspondence between physical distance on the graph and perceptual uniformity.
- Is widely used in computer graphics applications.
- 1960 - CIE adopted a chromaticity diagram to address the non-uniform scaling, called the **1960 CIE *u*, *v* chromaticity diagram.**
- However, the `u, v` approach was found to be perceptually unsatisfactory.
- As a consequence, in 1975, CIE proposed new `u'` and `v'` values.
- The new scaling became `u' = u` and `v' = 1.5v`.
- The revised diagram was adopted in 1976 CIE `u' - v'` diagram.

- The development of UCS solutions to address perceptual uniformity alters the resulting CIE chromaticity visualization.
- As a result, the Blue-Red portions are elongated and the achromatic White point is relocated in order to ensure a greater correspondence between physical and perceptual distances.
- The spectral locus is shortened and the Line of Purples is also altered.
