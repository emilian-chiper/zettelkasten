### Square Harmony
- For **square** harmony, four colors are equidistant and three steps apart on the color wheel.
- Together, they form a square on the color wheel that results in two pairs of complements.

#### Formula
- Square color schemes use a combination consisting of four colors set `90°` apart on the color wheel, in pairs of complements.
	- `H1 = |(H0 + 90°) - 360°`
	- `H2 = |(H0 + 180°) - 360°`
	- `H3 = |(H0 + 270°) - 360°`
