### Colorimetry
- **Colorimetry** is the science of color measurement and matching.
- Colorimetry provides a system of color measurement and specification based on the concept of equivalent-appearing stimuli.
- Colorimetry data are gathered from the empirical studies of colors matching by humans.
- Each human subjects uses the  three primary lights of RGB to match a designated *reference* color.
- When a match is established, the reference color can them be defined in terms of the respective RGB lights required to produce the equivalent reference color.
- The observer is developing a set of **tristimulus** values.

#### Challenges
- Handling reference color that cannot be tmatched.
- The practice developed is to apply a *negative light*.
- If the blend of RGB lights is too Reddish for color matching even though no Red light is shining, the human subject is permitted to shign some of the Red primary light on the reference color to make the desired match.
- These results are recorded.
- It is thus possible to match all remaining colors with any set of the RGB distinct colors using the *negative light* as noted above.
