### Visible Light Spectrum
- Color is both a psychological and physiological response to light waves of specific frequencies that strike our eyes.
- Human eyes are sensitive to a narrow subset of the range of frequencies in electromagnetic spectrum.
- This is called the *visible light spectrum*.
- *Range:* 390-780 nm.
- Specific wavelengths correspond to specific colors.
- As Newton defined it, the visible spectrum ranges from *short* wavelengths of Violet (380 nm) to *long* wavelengths of Red (750 nm), with Indigo (Dark Blue), Blue (Cyan), Green, Yellow, and Orange in between.
