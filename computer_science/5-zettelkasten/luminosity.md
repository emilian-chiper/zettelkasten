### Luminosity
- **Luminosity** is the perceived brightness of a color.
- This is not necessarily a numerical or measured value associated with a given color model.
- At 255 strength value for each RGB color, presented side by side â¬›ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¦â¬›, most viewers would agree that Green ðŸŸ¢ is perceptually lighter and more luminous than its neighbors.
- Red ðŸ”´ is in turn lighter than Blue ðŸ”µ.
- Although the numeric values indicate 100% brightness or luminosity (i.e. 255), we perceive different tones.
- If we convert the same image to Black and White, where the luminosity becomes 0% (000), we see the brightness of the RGB colors is equal.
- Differences in perceived luminosity become key parameters in assessing colorimetry data provided by human subjects and the development of the color spaces and systems.
