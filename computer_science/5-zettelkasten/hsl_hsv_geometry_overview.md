### Geometry of HSV and HSL
- HSV and HSL both use three axes to define their respective color space.
- HSV is usually represented as a cone or hexcone, defining the subset of the HSV space with valid RGB values.
- Similarly, the color solid for the HSL color space is a double cone or double hexcone.
- The three-axes approach is in some ways analogous to the [Munsell color Order System]([[munsell_color_system]]).
- HSV defines hue, saturation, and value, where *value* is sometimes referred to as *brightness*.
- HSL defines hue, saturation, and *lightness*, where sometimes the order is noted as hue lightness saturation (HSL).
