### Defining Hue
- In HSV and HSL, hue is used to describe the degrees of color.
- The specification of the hue axis ranges from 0 to 360°.
- This forms a color or hue wheel that begins at ends at Red (0/360), encompassing:
	- Yellow (60°) `#ff0`
	- Green (120°) `#0f0`
	- Cyan (180°) `#0ff`
	- Blue (240°) `#00f`
	- Magenta (300°) `#f0f`
- These hue ranges specifically address the primary colors of the RGB color mode for lights and the Cyyan Magenta Yellow primary colors of the CMYK color model for printing.
- The Red (0/360), Green (120), and Blue (240) RGB hues form a triangle when connected by straight lines on the hue wheel.
- The same is true for Yellow (60), Cyan (180), and Magenta (300) CMY hues.
