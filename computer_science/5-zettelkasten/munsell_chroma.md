### Chroma
- Chroma measures the weakness or strength of a color.
- It represents the purity of a color in regards to saturation.
- A low chroma value contains more Gray or pastel tones.
- A high chroma is highly saturated and more vivid in tone.
- The chroma axis extends from the value axis at a right angle.
- Chroma is not uniform across the color space, otherwise we would have the color sphere initially proposed by Munsell.
- Different hues of the Munsell color space can achieve full or saturated chroma at varying locations in the color space.
- The chroma scale starts at `0` for neutral colors and does not have an end.
- For example, the chroma scale of fully saturated Red can be written down as `5R 5/18` while a fully saturated Blue Green can be written as `5BG 5/6`.
- Thus, Red is considered to be thrice as strong as  Blue Green in the middle value `5N` location.
- Chroma paths can change at different steps on the value scale.
- Reds, Blues, and Purples attain full saturation at mid levels `5/-` of the value scale and are stronger hues with higher chroma values at full saturation.
- Yellows and Green reach full saturation at high value levels of `7/-` or `8/-`, and are weaker hues with full chroma saturation near the neutral axis.
