### Defining Saturation
- **Saturation** indicates the degree that a hue differs from neutral Gray in the color space.
- It ranges from `0%` for no color or *desaturation* to `100%` for a pure color or *full saturation*.
- As we move into the center of the color wheel, more Gray is added to the various hues, resulting in the colors dominating less and less.
- A faded hue or tone indicates the color contains more Gray.
- At the center of the wheel the neutral Gray zone is reached and no hue dominates.
- This is the zone of *complete desaturation* while the outer edge of the hue wheel is the region of *full saturation*.
- Saturation has similarities to the [chroma]([[munsell_chroma]]) parameter of the Munsell Color Order System.
