### Hue
- Principle hues:
	- Red (R) `#f00`
	- Yellow (Y) `#ff0`
	- Green (G) `#0f0`
	- Blue (B) `#00f`
	- Purple (P) `#9F00C5`
- These principle hues are equally spaces in clockwise order around a color circle or wheel.
- They are separated by five mixtures of intermediate hues:
	- Yellow Red (YR)
	- Green Yellow (GY)
	- Blue Green (BG)
	- Purple Blue (PB)
	- Red Purple (RP).
- The color wheel is measured by 100 compass points resulting in 100 steps on the hue circle.
- Each of the primary and intermediate colors is allocated a range of **10Â°** on the color circle and is located at the mid-point of the segment.
- In the Munsell notation, primary Yellow is identified as `5Y` and is at the mid point of its segment.
- A value of `2.5Y` indicates Yellow progressing toward Yellow Red and `7.5Y` transitioning towards Green Yellow.
- A value of `10Y` is the end point of the Yellow segment, positioned equally between primary Yellow `5Y` and intermediate Green Yellow `5GY`.
- This notation results in 40 standard hue circle divisions.
- In the Munsell notation, Orange is defined as Yellow Red.
- Two colors on the opposite sides of the hue wheel are called complementary colors.
- For `5Y`, the complementary color would be Purple Blue `5PB`.
- Combining `5Y` and `5PB` results in the `5N` neutral Gray color at the center of the Munsell hue wheel.
- The Munsell color notation is designed so that each color has a logical relationship to all other colors. This is called *color harmony*.
