### Web Safe Colors
- **Web safe colors** consist of **216** colors that have solid, nondithered, and consistent display on any display device supporting at least `8-bit` color (256 colors).
- The number of 216 web-safe colors was selected since the computer OS typically reserved 16-20 colors for their own use.
- The number 216 also allowed for 6 equally spaced shades for RGB values from 0 to 255 and also supported the 00 to FF range in hexadecimal notation.
- This mathematical notation can be simply notes as `6 * 6 * 6 = 216`.
- The Web safe colors developed were based on mathematics and not aesthetics or color theory.
- The 216 colors contain RGB values of 0, 51, 102, 153, 204, and 255, where RGB values range from 0 to 255.
- These numbers are multiples of 51 or 20% of 255 and result in the six equally spaced shades of RGB values at 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%.
- In the HEX triplet equivalents, the 216 colors contain HEX values 00, 33, 66, 99, CC, and FF.
- - Todayâ€™s display technologies typically support `24-bit` color or better so the need for Web safe color consideration is becoming obsolete.
