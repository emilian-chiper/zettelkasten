### Web Colors and Hex Triplets
- Guidelines maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
- A **Web color** is specified according to its intensity of RGB components.
- The Web color specifications are based on the [sRGB]([[color_space_sRGB]]) color space.
- sRGB was selected since it effectively serves as a best guess for how the majority of monitors, mobile phones, and digital cameras produce color.
- In setting parameters for displaying Web pages, colors can be defined in the RGB format or in hexadecimal (*hex triplet*) format.
- In some cases, Web colors can also be noted according to their English name.
- The *HEX triplet format*, with a leading hash sign (`#`) is the most common format used.
