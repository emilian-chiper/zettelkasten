### Metamerism for Color
- Let us assume that a set of Yellow 游리 wavelenghts (577-587 nm) enters the eye and strikes the retina.
- Light with these wavelengths activates the Red 游댮 and Green 游릭 cones to produce the *physiological response* in the form of electrical messages.
- The optical nerve sends the electrical messages to the brain.
- The brain recognizes that Red 游댮 and Green 游릭 cones were simultaneously activated and interprets this to mean that the color Yellow 游리 was observed.
- The lack of response from the Blue 游댯cones further confirms this interpretation.
- We do **NOT** see Yellow 游리 and Blue 游댯 together.
- This is the *psychological response* to the Yellow 游리 light.
- To add further complexity, if we send lights of Red 游댮 and Green 游릭 wavelengths to the eye simultaneously, the Red 游댮 light would primarily activate the Red 游댮 cones and the Green 游릭 light would primarily activate the Green 游릭 cones.
- Each set of cones would send their physiological messages to the brain through the optical nerve.
- The brain, trained to perceive the two simultaneous signals to mean Yellow 游리, would send a psychological response indicating that the Yellow 游리 light has been received.
- The brain has no means of distinguishing between a single set of Yellow 游리 wavelengths and a combination of Red 游댮 and Green 游릭 wavelengths combined.
- This combination of wavelengths to produce a response for another is an example of metamerism.
- **Metamerism for color** is defined as the matching of the apparent color of an object with spectral power distributions that are different from one another.
- Metamerism is a key concept in working with the RGB color model.
- The combination of RGB lights to create a combined color value is used in displays for electronic systems like digital cameras, televisions, computer or mobile phone displays, and video projectors.
- For these displays, each pixel on the screen combines three small and very close but slightly separated RGB light sources.
- These sources are indistinguishable at common viewing distances.
- Thus, our eye-brain color vision system perceives solid color.
