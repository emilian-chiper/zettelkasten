### WeakMap
The first difference between `Map` and `WeakMap` is that keys must be objects, not primitive values:

```JavaScript title:app.js
let weakMap = new WeakMap();

let obj = {};

weakMap.set(obj, "ok"); // works fine (object key)

// can't use a string as the key
weakMap.set("test", "Whoops"); // Error, because "test" is not an object
```

If we use an object as the key, and there are no other references to that object, it will be removed from memory (and from the map) automatically.

```JavaScript title:app.js
let john = { name: "John" };

let weakMap = new WeakMap();
weakMap.set(john, "...");

john = null; // overwrite the reference

// john is removed from memory
```

If `john` only exists as the key of `WeakMap` ‚Äì it will be automatically deleted from the map (and memory).

`WeakMap` doesn‚Äôt support iteration and methods `keys()`, `values()`, `entries()`, so there‚Äôs no way to get all keys or values from it.

`WeakMap` has only the following methods:
- `weakMap.set(key, value)`
- `weakMap.get(key)`
- `weakMap.delete(key)`
- `weakMap.has(key)`

**Why such limitation?**
If an object has lost all other references (like `john` in the code above), then it is to be garbage-collected automatically. But technically it‚Äôs not exactly specified *when the cleanup happens*.

The JavaScript engine decides that. It may choose to perform the memory cleanup immediately or to wait and do the cleaning later when more deletions happen. So, technically, the current element count of a `WeakMap` is not known. The engine may have cleaned it up or not, or did it partially. For that reason, methods that access all keys/values are not supported.

#### Use case: additional data
The main area of application of `WeakMap` is *additional data storage*.

If we‚Äôre working on an object that ‚Äúbelongs‚Äù to another code, maybe even a third-party library, and would like to store some data associated with it, that should only exist while the object is alive ‚Äì then `WeakMap` is exactly what‚Äôs needed.

We put the data to a `WeakMap`, using the object as the key, and when the object is garbage collected, that data will automatically disappear as well.

```JavaScript title:app.js
weaMap.set(john, "secret documents");
// if john dies, secret documents will be destroyed automatically
```

For instance, we have code that keeps a visit count for users. The information is stored in a map: a user object in the key and the visit count is the value. When a user leaves (its object gets garbage collected), we don‚Äôt want to store their visit count anymore.

Here‚Äôs an example of a counting function with `Map`:

```JavaScript title:app.js
// üìÅ visitsCount.js
let visitCountMap = new Map(); // map: user => visits count

// increase the visits count
function countUser(user) {
	let count = visitsCountMap.get(user) || 0;
	visitsCountMap.set(user, count + 1);
}
```

An here‚Äôs another part of the code, maybe another file using it:

```JavaScript title:app.js
// üìÅ main.js
let john = { name: "John" };

countUser(john); // count his visits

// late john leaves us
john = null;
```

Now, `john` object should be garbage collected, but remains in memory, as it‚Äôs a key in `visitsCountMap`.

We need to clean `visitsCountMap` when we remove users, otherwise it will grow in memory indefinitely. Such cleaning can become a tedious task in complex architectures.

We can avoid it by switching to `WeakMap` instead:

```JavaScript title:app.js
// üìÅ visitsCount.js
let visitsCountMap = new WeakMap(); // weakmap: user => visits count

// increase the visits count
function countUser(user) {
	let count = visitsCountMap.get(user) || 0
	visitsCountMap.set(user, count + 1);
}
```

Now we don‚Äôt have to clean `visitsCountMap`. After `john` object becomes unreachable, by all means except as a key of `WeakMap`, it gets removed from memory, along with the information by that key from `WeakMap`.

#### Use case: caching
Another common example is caching. We can store (‚Äúcache‚Äù) results from a function, so that future calls on the same object can reuse it.

To achieve that, we can use `Map` (no optimal scenario):

```JavaScript title:app.js
// üìÅ cache.js
let cache = new Map();

// calculate and remember the result
function process(obj) {
  if (!cache.has(obj)) {
    let result = /* calculations of the result for */ obj;

    cache.set(obj, result);
    return result;
  }

  return cache.get(obj);
}

// Now we use process() in another file:

// üìÅ main.js
let obj = {/* let's say we have an object */};

let result1 = process(obj); // calculated

// ...later, from another place of the code...
let result2 = process(obj); // remembered result taken from cache

// ...later, when the object is not needed any more:
obj = null;

alert(cache.size); // 1 (Ouch! The object is still in cache, taking memory!)
```

For multiple calls of `project(obj)` with the same object, it only calculates the result the first time, and then just takes it from `cache`. The downside is that we need to clean `cache` when the object is not needed any more.

If we replace `Map` with `WeakMap`, then this problem disappears. The cached result will be removed from memory automatically after the object gets garbage collected.

```JavaScript title:app.js
// üìÅ cache.js
let cache = new WeakMap();

// calculate and remember the result
function process(obj) {
	if(!cache.has(obj)) {
		let result = /* calculate the result for */ obj;

		cache.set(obj, result);
		return result;
	}

	return cache.get(obj);
}

// üìÅ main.js
let obj = { /* some object */ }

let result1 = process(obj);
let result2 = process(obj);

// ... later, when the object is not needed anymore:
obj = null;

// Can't get cache.size, as it's a WeakMap,
// but it's 0 or soon to be 0
// When obj gets garbage collected, cached data will be removed as well
```
