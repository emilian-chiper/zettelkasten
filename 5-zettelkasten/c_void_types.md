### void Types
The `void` type is rather strange. The keyword `void` means “cannot hold value”; e.g., you can use it to indicate that a function doesn’t return a value, or as the sole parameter of a function to indicate that the function takes no arguments. On the other hand, the *derived type* `void *` means that the pointer can reference *any* object.
