### Triad Harmony
- **Triad** harmony includes three colors that are equally spaced from each other on the color wheel.
- The equal spacing creates an equilateral triangle on the wheel.

#### Formula
- Triadic color schemes use a combination consisting of three colors set `120°` apart on the color wheel, in pairs of complements.
	- `H1 = |(H0 + 120°) - 360°`
	- `H2 = |(H0 + 240°) - 360°`
