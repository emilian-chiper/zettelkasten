### Styling Classes
Class names should be written in *CamelCase*. No underscores. Instance and module names should be written in lowercase, with underscores between words.

Every class should have a docstring immediately following the class definition. The docstring should be a brief description of what the class does, and you should follow the same formatting conventions used for function docstrings. Each module should also have a docstring describing what the classes in a module can be used for.

Donâ€™t abuse blank lines to organize code. You can use one blank line between methods, and within a module you can use two blank lines to separate classes.

If you need to import a module from the standard library and a module that you wrote, place the import statement from the standard library module first. Then, add a blank like and the import statements for your own modules.
