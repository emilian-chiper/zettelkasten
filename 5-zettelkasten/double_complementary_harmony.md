### Double Complementary Harmony
- The **double complementary** harmony includes two sets of complementary colors that are next to each other and across each other on the color wheel.
- For example, we include the key hue of Yellow it its adjacent color of Orange in the RGB/CMYK color space.
- This results in Yellow and Orange combining with their respective complements of Blue and Cyan Blue (Deep Sky Blue).
- In RYB color space, we show the key hue of Yellow with its adjacent color of Orange Yellow.
- This results in Yellow and Orange Yellow combining with their respective complements of Purple and Blue Purple.
- The two complementary pairs crossing each other form an X pattern on the color wheel.

#### Formula
Double complementary color schemes use a combination consisting of a base color (`H0`) and an adjacent color (`H1`),  as well as their respective opposites, `180°` on the opposite side of the color wheel.
- `H1 = |(H0 - 30°)|`
- `H2 = |(H0 + 180°) - 360°|`
- `H3 = |(H0 + 150°) - 360°|`
