### Autocorrection
The *autocorrection* is a very handy feature of `Date` objects. We can set out-of-range values, and it will auto-adjust itself. For instance:

```JavaScript title:app.js
let date = new Date(2013, 0, 32); // 32 Jan 2013 ?!?
alert(date); // ... is 1st Feb 2013!
```

Out-of-range date components are distributed automatically.

Let’s say we need to increase the date “28 Feb 2016” by 2 days. It may be “2 Mar” or “1 Mar” in case of a leap-year. We don’t need to think about it. Just add 2 days. The `Date` object will do the rest:

```JS title:app.js
let date = new Date(2016, 1, 28);
date.setDate(date.getDate() + 2);

alert(date); // 1 Mar 2016
```

That feature is often used to get the date after the given period of time. For instance, let’s get the date for “70 seconds after now”:

```JavaScript title:app.js
let date = new Date();
date.setSeconds(date.getSeconds() + 70);

alert(date); // shows the correct date
```

We can also set zero or even negative values. For example:

```JavaScript title:app.js
let date = new Date(2016, 0, 2); // 2 Jan 2016

date.setDate(1); // set day 1 of month
alert( date );

date.setDate(0); // min day is 1, so the last day of the previous month is assumed
alert( date ); // 31 Dec 2015
```
