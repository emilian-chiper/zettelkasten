### Split Complementary Harmony
- A **split complementary** harmony combines a key color with the two colors directly on either side of the complementary color.
- In RGB/CMYK color space, the hue of Yellow is complementary to Blue.
- Thus, the split complementary hues are Cyan Blue (Deep Sky Blue) and Blue Magenta (Purple).
- In the RYB color space, Yellow is complementary to Purple.
- Thus, the split complementary hues are Blue Purple and Purple Red.

#### Formula
- A split-complementary color scheme is a three-color combination that consists of a base color (`H0`) and two colors (`H1` and `H2`) that are `150°` and `210°` apart from `H0` respectively.
	- formula: `H1 = |(H0 + 150°) - 360°|`
	- formula: `H2 = |(H0 + 210° - 360°|`
