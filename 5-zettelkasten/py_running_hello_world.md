### What Really Happens When You Run hello_world.py
```Py title:hello_world.py
print("Hello Python world!")
```

The output should be:
```BASH title:output.sh
Hello Python world!
```

- The ending `.py` indicates that the file is a Python program.
- Your editor runs the file through the [[py_interpreter|Python Interpreter]], which reads through the program and determines what each word means.
- As you write your programs, your editor performs *syntax highlighting*.
