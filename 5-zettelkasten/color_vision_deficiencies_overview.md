### Color Vision Deficiencies
- Each person sees color differently.
- For individuals with normal color vision, these differences are slight.
- If the cones lack one or more of the light-sensitive pigments, it is not possible for the eye to view one or more of the RGB primary colors.
- This is defined as a *color vision deficiency* or as a type of color blindness.
- The most common types of color blindness are considered to be hereditary and result from defects in genes that contain instructions for producing the photopigments found in cones.
 - The genes for photopigment production are carried on the X chromosome.
 - Only one of the X chromosomes is sufficient to produce the required photoreceptors for color vision.
 - If these genes are missing or damaged, the probability is higher that a color deficiency will appear in *males* rather than females.
 - This is due to males having only one X chromosome and females having two.
 - A color defficiency can also be produced by physical or chemical damage to the eye, optic nerve, or parts of the brain.
