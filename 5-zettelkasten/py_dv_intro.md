### Generating Data
*Data visualization* is the use of visual representations to explore and present patterns in datasets. It’s closely associated with *data analysis*, which uses code to explore the patterns and connections in a dataset. A dataset can be a small list of numbers that fits in a single line of code, or it can be terabytes of data that include many different kinds of information.

Data scientists have have written an impressive array of visualization and analysis tools in Python, many of which are available to you as well. One of the most popular tools is Matplotlib, a mathematical plotting library. We’ll use matplotlib to make simple plots, such as line graphs and scatter plots. Then, we’ll create a more interesting dataset based on the concept of a random walk–a visualization generated from a series of random decisions.

We’ll also use a package called Plotly, which creates visualizations that work well on digital devices, to analyze the results of rolling dice. Plotly generates visualizations that automatically resize to fit a variety of display devices. These visualizations can also include a number of interactive features, such as emphasizing particular aspects of the dataset when users hover over different parts of the visualization. Learning to use Matplotlib and Plotly will help you get started visualizing the kinds of data you’re most interested in.
