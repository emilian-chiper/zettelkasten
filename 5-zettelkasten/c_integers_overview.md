### Overview
Each integer type represents a finite range of integers. Signer integer types represent values that can be negative, zero, or positive; unsigned integers represent values that can be only zero or positive.

The range that each type of integer can represent depends on your implementation.

The *value* of an integer object is the ordinary mathematical value sorted in the object.

The `representation` of a value for an integer object is the particular encoding of the value in the bits of the object allocated storage.
