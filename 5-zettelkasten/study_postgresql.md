### Conventions
The following conventions are used in the synopsis of a command:
- brackets (`[` and `]`) indicate optional parts,
- braces (`{` and `}`) and vertical lines (`|`) indicate that you must choose one alternative,
- dots (`...`) mean that the preceding element can be repeated.
All other symbols, including parentheses, should be take literally.

Where it enhances the clarity, SQL commands are preceded by the prompt `=>`, and shell commands are preceded by the prompt `$`. Normally, prompts are not shown, though.

An *administrator* is generally a person who is in charge of installing and running the server.
A *user* could be anyone who is using, or wants to use, any part of the PostgreSQL system.
