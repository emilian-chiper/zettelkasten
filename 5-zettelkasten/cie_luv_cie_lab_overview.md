### CIE LUV and CIE LAB
- 1942 - David Lewis MacAdam noted the non-uniform scaling of the CIE x-y chromaticity visualization.
- He showed that the physical distance of two colors on the CIE x-y chromaticity diagram may not be equivalent to their *perceptual distance*.
- To correct this limitation, a number of **uniform chromaticity scale** (UCS) solutions were proposed.
- The UCS solutions used mathematical relationships to transform the XYZ values or the x and y coordinates to a new set of values that created a more nearly perceptually uniform two-dimensional color space.
- Additionally, the Y lightness scale was replaced was replaced with a new scale called `L` that was approximately uniformly spaced and more indicative of actual visual differences.
- 1976 - CIE adopted two color spaces that more effectively showed uniform color spacing in their values.
- The `L` lightness is used in both of these color spaces.
- The CIE LUV color space was designed specifically for emissive colors that correspond to images captured by a camera or created by computer graphics rendering programs.
- The CIE LAB color space was developed to characterize color surfaces and dyes.
- CIE LAB is widely used in the color imaging and printing industries.
- For the mathematical relationships of the UCS solutions as well as further technical information on CIE LUV and CIE LAB, see [Digital Color Imaging Handbook]().
