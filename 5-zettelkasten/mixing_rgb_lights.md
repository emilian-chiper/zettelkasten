### Mixing RGB Lights
- Produces the color gamut of display devices.
- Is not always intuitive or perceptually relevant.
- HSV and HSL were developed to accommodate more traditional and intuitive ways of mixing colors, like those used for centuries by painters, with the RYB color space.
- Painters mix bring and colorful pigments with:
	- white `#fff` to achieve a *tint*,
	- gray `#a9a9a9` to achieve a *tone*
	- black `#000` to achieve a *shade*.
