### Pantone Color Matching System
- The **Pantone color matching system** (PMS) is a proprietary color space used primarily in printing and also in a wide range of other industries, including cosmetics, colored paint, fabric, and plastics.
- Pantone matching methods have evolved into a standardized color reproduction system that utilizes the Pantone numbering system to identify colors.
- The Pantone color guides consist of narrow cardboard sheets (approx. `6/2 in` or `15/5 cm`) that are printed on one side with rectangular samples showing the different Pantone colors.
