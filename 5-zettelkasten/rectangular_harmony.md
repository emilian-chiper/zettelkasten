### Rectangular Harmony
- With **rectangular** harmony, four hues are equally distant and form a rectangle on the color wheel.
- The result combines two pairs of complementary colors that are two steps apart on the color wheel.
- For example, the key hue of Yellow and its Blue complement are two steps from Green and its Magenta complement on the RGB/CMYK color wheel.
- Meanwhile, Yellow and its Purple complement are two steps from Green and its complement Red on the RYB color wheel.

#### Formula
- Rectangular color schemes use a combination consisting of a two base colors (`H0` and `H1`) set `60°` as well as their respective opposites, `180°` on the opposite side of the color wheel.
- `H1​=∣(H0​+60°)−360°∣`
- `H2=∣(H0+180°)−360°`
- `H3=∣(H0+240°)−360°`
