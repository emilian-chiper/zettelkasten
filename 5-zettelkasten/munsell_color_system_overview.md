### The Munsell Color System
- A 3D model that defines color as having three attributes: *hue*, *value*, *chroma*.
- 1890s - Albert H. Munsell.
- The system is built on the representation of equally perceived color differences as a branching geometry called a *color tree*.
- Is also fundamental to many color specifications that followed it, such as [CIE LAB]([[cie_lab_color_space]]).
