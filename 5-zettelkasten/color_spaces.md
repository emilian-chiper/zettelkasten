### Color Spaces
- RGB Color Model + Color Gamut = Color Space.
- A color space can be an arbitrary color system or structured mathematically.
- The *Pantone matching system* (PMS) is an example of an arbitrary color system based on color swatches and corresponding assigned names.
- A color model with a mathematical structure can be represented as **tuples** of numbers.
- For the RGB color model, three numbers represent the RGB values, e.g. Yellow is represented as (255, 255, 0).
- There are several specific color spaces based on the RGB color model.
- A complete specification of an RGB color space also includes a White point chromaticity value and a *gamma correction curve*.
- See [Ibrahim et al.](), [Schnada](), and [Susstrunk, Buckley, and Swen]() for a deeper understanding of the RGB color space.
